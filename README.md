## Client (running on Port 3000)

React creates its own readme in the client folder. It has pretty detailed instructions on how to run the app.

## Sever (running on Port 8080)

The first time you run this app first install nodemon globally using the following command:

```
npm install --global nodemon
```

This allows you to run the application in development mode.

Some common command that will be used:

This command installs all the necessary packages used by the application

```
npm install
```

This command run the application in development mode

```
npm run dev
```

This command build the application (usually you don't run this when developing unless you want to see what it looks like when depolyed)

```
npm run build
```
